ACER 3820T battery reader
=========================

A simple program to read battery information over i2c
using Arduino Uno.

Uses SoftI2CMaster library for i2c communication with a small patch
to implement very slow communication speed.

More information available in http://blog.tajuma.com/?p=16, how to use
this and eventually re-flash the Acer 3820 BIOS/KBC with a fixed
firmware.
